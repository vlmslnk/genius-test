            <li>
              <p>
                A conventional mortgage loan is a “conforming” loan (it meets
                the requirements for Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac). Fannie Mae and
                Freddie Mac are government sponsored operations that buy

          <h3>FHA Loans</h3>

            <li>
              <p>
                FHA loans are backed by the US Government. The interest rates
                are traditionally lower, and you only need a 3.5% down payment.
                FHA loans have less stringent credit guidelines compared to
                conventional mortgages...

                VA helps Service members, Veterans, and eligible surviving
                spouses become homeowners. VA guarantees a portion of the loan,
                enabling the lender to provide you with more favorable terms. No

            <li>
              <p>
                With a rate-and-term refinance, the current mortgage is replaced
                with a new interest rate and term length. With a cash-out
                refinance, the current mortgage is replaced with a loan larger
                than what is left to pay on the home, so the surplus can be
                received in cash.
